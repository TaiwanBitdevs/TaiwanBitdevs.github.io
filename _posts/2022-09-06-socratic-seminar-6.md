## Announcements

Our sixth Socratic Seminar event will be held at our typical location 9 LiShui St. Da'An Dist. Taipei.

We will start the socratic seminar discussion with general introductions and follow with discussion on the latest bitcoin developents. As time permits, a demo of LNURL standards will be presented by lightning network contributors of BitDevs and Diamond Hands

Learn about bitcoin development. Share, debate, and discuss trade offs in progress. Skim the [discussion topics](https://github.com/TaiwanBitdevs/TaiwanBitdevs.github.io/pull/11) on GitHub. We discuss a variety of developments, from industry updates and press releases, pull requests in popular git repositories (e.g. Bitcoin Core, lnd, c-lightning, rust-bitcoin, Joinmarket, WasabiWallet), research papers, technical blog posts, IRC logs, network monitors and more. Please add to the discussion topics on GitHub. We'd love to hear from you. After the event the we socialize over food and drinks. 

我們每月舉辦的蘇格拉底式的研討會活動旨在促進辯論、信息共享和開放討論。在活動前幾週,聚會成員會從各種來源去整理討論主題：流行git倉儲（例如 Bitcoin Core、lnd、c-lightning、rust-bitcoin, Joinmarket、WasabiWallet）中的pull requests、研究論文、技術博客帖文、IRC 日誌、網絡監測等。經過一段時間的討論，一些活動會有來自開源項目、公司、研究和其他相關內容的介紹。隨後是反饋和問答部分。活動結束後，我們會在活動場地進行社交。

## Discussion Topics

### Fedimint (formerlly Minimint) developments

Fedimint refers to a rust implementation of a federated chaumian e-cash mint; a model for distributed custody.

### Using routing fees to signal liquidity

Using routing fees to signal liquidity: developer ZmnSCPxj posted to the Lightning-Dev mailing list an argument for how optimally cheap and reliable payments could be obtained through game theoretic behavior between spenders and routing nodes:

- Spenders should choose paths that charge less in routing fees.

- Routing nodes should charge more to use a channel as its capacity decreases. E.g., if most of the balance in a channel is owned by Alice, she can reliably forward payments to Bob and so she shouldn’t charge much; but, as more balance is forwarded towards Bob, Alice’s ability to forward additional payments decreases, so she should charge higher fees.


### X-only workaround

Bitcoin public keys are points on a two-dimensional graph which are referenced by the intersection of an x coordinate and a y coordinate. For any given x coordinate, there are only two valid y coordinates and these can be calculated from the x value. This allowed an optimization in the design of taproot to require all public keys used with BIP340-style schnorr signatures to only use a certain one of these y coordinates, allowing any public keys included in transactions to omit including the y point entirely, saving one vbyte per signature over the original taproot design.

At the time, this technique (called x-only public keys) was thought to be an optimization with no significant tradeoffs, but later design work on OP_TAPLEAF_UPDATE_VERIFY (TLUV) revealed that x-only pubkeys required either computationally limiting the proposal or storing extra data in the block chain or UTXO set. The problem may affect other advanced uses of pubkeys as well.

This week, Tim Ruffing posted to the Bitcoin-Dev mailing list a potential workaround that only requires a slight bit of additional computation by signers—an amount that even a resource-constrained hardware signing device can probably perform without making its user wait too long.

### Allowing deliberately slow LN payment forwarding

In a reply to a thread about recursive/nested MuSig2 (see Newsletter #204) and the latency that nodes using it would add when routing payments, developer Peter Todd asked on the Lightning-Dev mailing list whether it would “be worthwhile to allow people to opt-in to their payments happening more slowly for privacy?” For example, if Alice and Bob each sent forward-slowly payments around the same time through Carol’s forwarding node to Dan’s forwarding node, Carol would be able to forward both payments together, reducing the amount of privacy-leaking information about the participants that third parties could discover through balance probing, network activity surveillance, or other techniques. Developer Matt Corallo agreed it was an interesting idea.

### Full RBF in Bitcoin Core

Replace by fee allows transactions to be [R]eplaced [b]y later transactions paying a higher [fee]. bitcoin core #25353 introduces `mempoolfullrbf` option which allows any transaction to be replaced. Previously, only transactions that opt-in with a flag could be replaced.

### Zero-conf channel opens in LND and Core Lightning

Core Lightning #5275 adds support for zero-conf channel opens and the related Short Channel IDentifier (SCID) aliases (see Newsletter #203). This includes updates to the listpeers, fundchannel, and multifundchannel RPCs.

### Bitcoin Ordinals

####  What are ordinals?

Ordinals are numbers, like this: 804766073970493. Every satoshi, which is ¹⁄₁₀₀₀₀₀₀₀₀ of a bitcoin, has an ordinal, and every ordinal has a satoshi. When a satoshi changes hands, so does its ordinal. There are a lot of satoshis, and so there are a lot of ordinals. Two quadrillion ninety-nine trillion nine hundred ninety-nine billion nine hundred ninety-seven million six hundred ninety thousand, to be precise.

#### What can ordinals do?

Ordinals can be used for anything needing a public, persistent, transferable, decentralized identity. This includes NFTs, accounts, stablecoins, PKI, and more. For more ideas, see the BIP.

#### What are ordinals not?

Ordinals are not a side chain, do not require any changes to the bitcoin protocol, and are extremely simple.
