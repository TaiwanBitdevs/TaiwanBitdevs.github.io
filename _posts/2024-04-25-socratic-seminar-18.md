## Announcements

Bitdevs Taiwan has missed you all!

The team behind Frostsnap (a revolutionary multisignature hardware device) will join us in Taiwan for the first time! The team will host a Personal Security Workshop, involving an introduction to Bitcoin signing devices (aka hardware wallets), then a discussion of real Bitcoin security risks and practical mitigations. Additionally, a demo of their latest Frostsnap prototypes.

The venue will be at the up and coming T3CO co-working space (17F, No. 563, Sec. 4, Zhongxiao E.
Rd., Taipei).

Rough Agenda: 7pm (meet and greet), 7:30pm (start workshop), 8:30pm (start socratic).
